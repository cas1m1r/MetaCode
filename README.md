# Meta Code 
For me its best to learn by doing. And I have a lot of things I want to learn right now. 
Theres a few challenges on HTB driving me crazy, all my existing tools dont quite get me
any flags, and my knowledge is making is such that I see how to possibly solve things but
just not the grasp of how to fully do it. 


So this project is gonna get two birds stoned at once, and maybe also wind up with a useful tool.
